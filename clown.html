<h3>Gamzee Makara</h3>
<p>Gamzee Makara, also known by his Trollian handle, terminallyCapricious, is one of the trolls in Homestuck. His associated zodiac sign is Capricorn and his horns resemble a goat. He uses purple as a text color, and used to type with each letter alternating case. After sobering up, his lines alternate between all caps and all lowercase.</p>


<p>Gamzee was shown in his hive, which is decorated with posters depicting demonic clowns, taken from images of three Insane Clown Posse joker cards, The Carnival of Carnage, The Ringmaster, and The Riddle Box, with horns added. Among the things that litter his hive are bottles of Faygo, an oversized unicycle, a laptop, juggling clubs, pie tins filled with sopor slime, and several bike horns.

Since his custodian is always out at sea, Gamzee wasn't brought up very well. He wasn't taught certain simple things and common troll knowledge, such as the fact that sopor slime is not supposed to be eaten, lest strange things happen to a troll's head. Gamzee's lusus resembles a large mer-goat. This follows the trend of the custodians resembling the zodiac symbol of their charges, as Capricorn is the sign of the goat, or the sea-goat.

Although Gamzee doesn't seem to care about the caste system, he is a higher-up (the highest of the land-dwellers) in the blood-caste system. This is frequently referenced by Equius, who forces himself to suppress the urge to order Gamzee around because he has no right to be disappointed by [his] conduct. Equius also appears to believe that Gamzee's love of Faygo and sopor slime is harmful to him, as he tells Gamzee that you pollute your precious b100d / With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins. However, when Gamzee becomes sober he does seem to adopt the caste system ideology and even commands Equius to kneel before him. Gamzee is the only purple-blooded troll not seen wearing jewelry, though whether this is because he doesn't care about the system, or because of his Juggalo lifestyle, or just because he isn't a sea dweller, it's hard to tell.</p>

<p>Gamzee hadn't had much to do or say since Jack's entry into their session. He has simply been seen charging people boondollars for a lovely nap on his horn pile, or dancing around capriciously. That is, until he runs out of sopor slime pies, he stares into the eyes of Lil Cal following his angry departure at Dave mocking his religion, and in his mentally vulnerable state comes to the conclusions that:

<p>1. sopor slime was destroying his brain (likely to be true),</p>
<p>2. he is a descendant of the High Subjugglators (true),</p>
<p>3. he is both of the messiahs of his own religion (controversial),</p>
<p>4. he has to kill everyone (highly troubling),</p>
<p>5. and paint pictures with their blood (terrifying).</p>

<p>With his ability to interfere with dream selves he also manipulated the Dream Rooms of Dave and John to implant Lil Cal and a clown plush resembling Jack Noir respectively into their dreams. This would ultimately lead to John's prototyping of the harlequin doll. According to him, this made the kid's session terminal, possibly true as Jack used The Miles on their universe, and Gamzee was partly responsible for his uprising through a complex series of events including placing the dolls there.

Karkat (Gamzee's ex moirail), at this point, regards Gamzee's declaration as the current greatest threat facing the surviving trolls, even more so than Eridan's rampage. He says that Gamzee did more damage during the fight with the Black King than any of the other trolls, with the possible exception of Vriska.</p>

<h3> Relationships </h3>
<h4> Tavros Nitram </h4>
<img align="left" src="https://encrypted-tbn1.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcQl5vLBrLxN0DIN1zTdB1_kd8bs10Y86DxHu79PytQpJ3lZ8nOzIg"/>
<p>Gamzee appears to have had a strong relationship with Tavros. They formed one of the worst rapping duos in, well, all of paradox space. Tavros' mood and text seemed a lot more confident and mellow when talking to Gamzee. They also referred to each other as "bros" in a respectful way, also copying each other's text faces. It is strongly referenced that Gamzee once had flushed feelings for Tavros, even suggesting that they should make out at the end of said conversation, although Tavros seemed speechless at the idea, leaving it unknown if he shared the red feelings. His love for Tavros is further indicated when he says the brown potion (e.g. Tavros' blood) will cause you to lose the use of your legs, but make you a great kisser. After finding Tavros' corpse, Gamzee is seen with his blood on his lips implying that he tried to revive him (Although this is questionable, as he states that he wants to kill ALL of the trolls) or just had sloppy necrophiliac makeouts. It is unknown if Gamzee has any knowledge of Tavros and Vriska's complicated relationship; he may have simply been too stoned to care. Interestingly, Gamzee appears to show genuine sadness when talking to Dave about Tavros's death, and as mentioned above, he may have tried to revive him; he even goes so far as to refer to him as his "best friend," a title otherwise only bestowed upon Lil Cal after Tavros's death. These feelings may be more reflective of the aforementioned red crush he had on Tavros, especially considering that he cut his head off, seemingly to carry it around and kiss it whenever he felt like it. Like many other things about Gamzee, though, his true feelings towards Tavros are ultimately unknown. </p>

  <h4> Karkat Vantas </h4>
  <img align ="right" src="https://encrypted-tbn3.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcRRPIbMFaaflETJopB1PGjHDWxGFWKzYRAdljyGHMNojczi9SKT"/>
  <p>Gamzee apparently sees Karkat as his best friend, despite a strained relationship from Karkat's end, becoming a huge understatement later on. Gamzee doesn't take Karkat's insults seriously, and always checks up on him. Later on, Karkat is shown as expressing worry about Gamzee when he disappears, afraid he's gotten hurt, and even says that he should maybe look for him later. He is also horrified by Gamzee's new personality, trying desperately to snap him out of it. Finally, Karkat admits that he was not only Gamzee's best friend, but Gamzee was his best friend as well. Nepeta's shipping wall later shows her opinion that Karkat and Gamzee should be moirails. This relationship comes to fruition after Gamzee's flipout. It is later revealed that their moirallegiance has ended, due to Gamzee not holding up his end of the relationship. Gamzee and Karkat eventually become hostile to each other after Karkat and Kanaya watch Gamzee brutally hurt Terezi on LOFAF and charge at him, but to no avail as Gamzee uses Terezi's cane to stab Karkat twice in the chest and drop him into the lava.</p>

  <h4> Kanaya Maryam </h4>
  <img align="left" src="https://encrypted-tbn0.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcTqiaZtf5V8lIYIxOzLdz-jc4V03ULNvcJ9U5Rdk87gxu71oKoO"/>
  <p>Kanaya and Gamzee have had little to no contact or relationship prior to Hivebent. After his flip-out, Kanaya interrupted a three-way showdown between Gamzee, Vriska and Eridan by kicking him in the shame globes hard enough to send him off a cliff, but he was later unharmed through mysterious means despite the high fall.

She voiced her intention to kill him after he began stealing bodies, but she was stopped by Karkat. However, she remained suspicious of him for the rest of the trip aboard the meteor, suspicion which would later prove well-founded when he was revealed to be working for Lord English. In the Game Over timeline, their hostility culminated in Kanaya finally chainsawing Gamzee apart before dying herself.</p>

<h4> Terezi Pyrope </h4>
<img align="right" src="https://encrypted-tbn2.gstatic.com/images?q=tbn:ANd9GcS-SmV7LT2vK82XXppZxaTXIB6L3_pgx_uFX0rIC89FrKSr9Vwb"/>
<p>In the third part of Openbound he confirms that he has secretly started up a kismesissitude with Terezi, stating that she hates him for what he is but not enough to kill him. He doesn't want Karkat to find out about this, as he thinks Karkat would kill him for it, the exact reasoning behind Gamzee's belief that Karkat would kill him is unknown. Much of their relationship is open to speculation, as their only on-panel interaction following their kismessitude involved Terezi's attempted murder of Gamzee and his own aggressive retaliation. While their full dynamic is open for interpretation, the story largely portrays it as unhealthy, given that rivalry is key, and the relationship eventually turns bad enough for Terezi to try to kill Gamzee. In addition, while Gamzee appears to be more or less the same as he was three years ago, while Terezi's mental health and self-esteem appears to have declined. Assigning all the blame to Gamzee would be incorrect, given Terezi's guilt over killing Vriska, and her belief that her dancestor, Latula, is much more accepted and radical than her, though Gamzee has definitely had some role in this, mocking her blindness to the point that a combination of these three factors leads to her getting the eyes healed, a decision she is shown to immensely regret. However, post-retcon, Terezi seems to have avoided a black relationship with Gamzee altogether, apparently due largely to Vriska's influence, and the relationship ultimately remains no more than a black crush from Gamzee's side.</p>

<p>At the beginning of Hivebent, it seems Gamzee is on friendly terms with most of the other trolls. Due to his infinitely casual attitude to life, he is unaffected by Karkat's insults, Equius' bossiness or Eridan's emotional theatrics, all of which have been known to grate everyone else's nerves. Later on, Gamzee does a graceful pirouette-swan-dive off the deep end, possibly because of a combination of running out of slime for his pies and having a major faith crisis because of the video Dave showed him. This puts him into a rage that causes him to make the kids' universe "Terminal". Gamzee has now declared his intentions to murder the rest of the trolls to show them the new interpretation of his religion. However Karkat's combinations of shooshes and paps seem to have ended his rage. During the 3 year meteor trip Gamzee distanced himself from almost everyone on the meteor and, together with his dancestor, Kurloz, started working for Lord English. Eridan, Nepeta, and Feferi, each of whom had almost no relationship with him, come to terms after becoming Erisolsprite and Fefetasprite by agreeing on a sound policy of "Gamzee is stupid". The non-prototyped version of Sollux also holds him in low regard, calling him a braindead clown who eats toxic slime. Interestingly, Sollux seems to have had a brief vacillating concupiscent crush on Gamzee during Karkat's and his showdown on the roof, where also Terezi develops a black crush on him, and Kanaya an ashen one.</p>
