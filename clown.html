<h3>Gamzee Makara</h3>
<p>Gamzee Makara, also known by his Trollian handle, terminallyCapricious, is one of the trolls in Homestuck. His associated zodiac sign is Capricorn and his horns resemble a goat. He uses purple as a text color, and used to type with each letter alternating case. After sobering up, his lines alternate between all caps and all lowercase.</p>


<p>Gamzee was shown in his hive, which is decorated with posters depicting demonic clowns, taken from images of three Insane Clown Posse joker cards, The Carnival of Carnage, The Ringmaster, and The Riddle Box, with horns added. Among the things that litter his hive are bottles of Faygo, an oversized unicycle, a laptop, juggling clubs, pie tins filled with sopor slime, and several bike horns.

Since his custodian is always out at sea, Gamzee wasn't brought up very well. He wasn't taught certain simple things and common troll knowledge, such as the fact that sopor slime is not supposed to be eaten, lest strange things happen to a troll's head. Gamzee's lusus resembles a large mer-goat. This follows the trend of the custodians resembling the zodiac symbol of their charges, as Capricorn is the sign of the goat, or the sea-goat.

Although Gamzee doesn't seem to care about the caste system, he is a higher-up (the highest of the land-dwellers) in the blood-caste system. This is frequently referenced by Equius, who forces himself to suppress the urge to order Gamzee around because he has no right to be disappointed by [his] conduct. Equius also appears to believe that Gamzee's love of Faygo and sopor slime is harmful to him, as he tells Gamzee that you pollute your precious b100d / With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins. However, when Gamzee becomes sober he does seem to adopt the caste system ideology and even commands Equius to kneel before him. Gamzee is the only purple-blooded troll not seen wearing jewelry, though whether this is because he doesn't care about the system, or because of his Juggalo lifestyle, or just because he isn't a sea dweller, it's hard to tell.</p>

<p>Gamzee hadn't had much to do or say since Jack's entry into their session. He has simply been seen charging people boondollars for a lovely nap on his horn pile, or dancing around capriciously. That is, until he runs out of sopor slime pies, he stares into the eyes of Lil Cal following his angry departure at Dave mocking his religion, and in his mentally vulnerable state comes to the conclusions that:

<p>1. sopor slime was destroying his brain (likely to be true),</p>
<p>2. he is a descendant of the High Subjugglators (true),</p>
<p>3. he is both of the messiahs of his own religion (controversial),</p>
<p>4. he has to kill everyone (highly troubling),</p>
<p>5. and paint pictures with their blood (terrifying).</p>

<p>With his ability to interfere with dream selves he also manipulated the Dream Rooms of Dave and John to implant Lil Cal and a clown plush resembling Jack Noir respectively into their dreams. This would ultimately lead to John's prototyping of the harlequin doll. According to him, this made the kid's session terminal, possibly true as Jack used The Miles on their universe, and Gamzee was partly responsible for his uprising through a complex series of events including placing the dolls there.

Karkat (Gamzee's ex moirail), at this point, regards Gamzee's declaration as the current greatest threat facing the surviving trolls, even more so than Eridan's rampage. He says that Gamzee did more damage during the fight with the Black King than any of the other trolls, with the possible exception of Vriska.</p>
