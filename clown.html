<h3>Gamzee Makara</h3>
<p>Gamzee Makara, also known by his Trollian handle, terminallyCapricious, is one of the trolls in Homestuck. His associated zodiac sign is Capricorn and his horns resemble a goat. He uses purple as a text color, and used to type with each letter alternating case. After sobering up, his lines alternate between all caps and all lowercase.</p>


<p>Gamzee was shown in his hive, which is decorated with posters depicting demonic clowns, taken from images of three Insane Clown Posse joker cards, The Carnival of Carnage, The Ringmaster, and The Riddle Box, with horns added. Among the things that litter his hive are bottles of Faygo, an oversized unicycle, a laptop, juggling clubs, pie tins filled with sopor slime, and several bike horns.

Since his custodian is always out at sea, Gamzee wasn't brought up very well. He wasn't taught certain simple things and common troll knowledge, such as the fact that sopor slime is not supposed to be eaten, lest strange things happen to a troll's head. Gamzee's lusus resembles a large mer-goat. This follows the trend of the custodians resembling the zodiac symbol of their charges, as Capricorn is the sign of the goat, or the sea-goat.

Although Gamzee doesn't seem to care about the caste system, he is a higher-up (the highest of the land-dwellers) in the blood-caste system. This is frequently referenced by Equius, who forces himself to suppress the urge to order Gamzee around because he has no right to be disappointed by [his] conduct. Equius also appears to believe that Gamzee's love of Faygo and sopor slime is harmful to him, as he tellsSburb Logo Gamzee that you pollute your precious b100d / With your bottled fizzy sugar and soporific to%ins. However, when Gamzee becomes sober he does seem to adopt the caste system ideology and even commands Equius to kneel before him. Gamzee is the only purple-blooded troll not seen wearing jewelry, though whether this is because he doesn't care about the system, or because of his Juggalo lifestyle, or just because he isn't a sea dweller, it's hard to tell.</p>
