<h3> Kurloz Makara </h3>
<p>Kurloz Makara is the Prince of Rage and Gamzee's dancestor.

He does not speak as he chewed out his own tongue - he is described by Meenah as having a "stitched up mouth", a literal fact later confirmed through exposition. He seems to gain enjoyment from having signed conversations with Meulin Leijon, who is deaf and uses sign language. He wears a skeleton costume.

He appears to be some sort of a mime, parallel to Gamzee's clown. </p>

<p>His name could be a reference to Coulrophobia, which is an intense fear of clowns due to clown based nature of him and his religion, paired with his sinister motives. It has been played in with this way in other places too such as with Coulroz in Whisper of a Rose.

Kurloz' name also sounds similar to the Chinese pronouncing of the word 'skeletons', 'Kūlóu'.</p>

<p>Upon exiting Terezi's hive as Meenah, a small "scene" (Aranea's Exposition) gives more information about some of the pre-scratch Sgrub players:

The Prince of Rage actually used to be quite talkative. That is, until he had a nightmare which prompted a bizarre incident, after which he would never speak again. He took a sort of spiritual vow of silence, which I'm sure was probably related to his esoteric faith. Once, well before our session began, Kurloz and Meulin were in a very loving matespritship. It really seemed to everyone they were made for each other. One day, they fell asleep together. Kurloz then had a nightmare so terrifying, he released the most dreadful sound imaginable. It truly echoed the horror of the Vast Honk itself. The noise was so loud and so awful, Meulin went completely deaf, and her hearing never recovered. Kurloz was undoubtedly devastated by what he'd done to her. He was so distraught, he chewed off his tongue and sewed his mouth shut and has never spoken a word since.

Kurloz was later seen working with his dancestor, Gamzee, helping him assemble his fake god tier outfit to wear while helping Caliborn in his session. He was also seen following Vriska Serket and her party of trolls on their treasure hunt for Lord English's weakness. He picks up Vriska's discarded overcoat, which resembles English's Cairo Overcoat.

When Meenah was rallying up the ghost army, Kurloz (along with Damara, Aranea and other Vriskas besides the main one) was not present. It can be inferred that he chose not to because of his religious dedication to Lord English.</p>

<h3> Relations </h3>
<h4> Meulin Leijon </h4>

<p>Kurloz and Meulin were in a matespritship prior to the events of the game, but have since split. Kurloz is mentioned to deeply regret deafening her, although she bears no ill will against him for it. As shown from Openbound, they remain friends and converse regularly, however she remains unaware that he regularly uses her as a pawn for his religion by mind-controlling her. According to Aranea, Meulin sometimes expresses support for Kurloz's religion. </p>

<h4> Mituna Captor </h4>

<p> Mituna is Kurloz's moirail, but it is unclear which way this goes. On their only on-screen interaction, Mituna is jovial with Kurloz, calling him BUDDY and complimenting his wardrobe.  Kurloz was also the only eye witness to the event which caused his moirail Mituna to overexert himself and permanently burn out his psychic abilities. According to Aranea, he applied every last bit of energy he had to save his friends from a looming threat. Whether this threat had something to do with Kurloz is unknown.</p>

<h4> Gamzee Makara </h4>

<p>Kurloz has been shown to have entered a dark alliance with his dancestor Gamzee. Their interactions reveal little about the relationship between them except that Kurloz appears to serve as Gamzee's dogsbody, (ironic, given his class as a Prince and post-scratch title as The Grand Highblood) gathering various objects related to Caliborn and pieces of Gamzee's god tier robes. It is also clear that despite being older and probably stronger than his dancestor, Kurloz perceives Gamzee as his superior in at least one regard, and serves him ungrudgingly and without hesitation. Gamzee himself is less than positive about Kurloz's behaviour, but goes along with it for Caliborn's sake.</p>
