<h3> The Grand Highblood</h3>
<p>The ancestor of Gamzee Makara, the post-scratch incarnation of Kurloz Makara, and the leader of the subjuggulators. Like his descendant, the Grand Highblood was violent and deadly, and belonged to a juggalo-like cult.

The Grand Highblood was in charge of keeping the lower castes in check during his reign, operating much as an enforcer for the Condesce's regime. However, he was known to be capricious and unpredictable, rendering this point moot. It's possible that he was responsible for the fate of the Sufferer and many of his followers. On post-scratch Earth, his role was mirrored by the Juggalo presidency.

After Dualscar's kismesissitude with Mindfang failed, he offered her location to the Highblood. Mindfang wrote in her journal that this plan either would, or already did, fail spectacularly due to the subjugglator's sanguinary nature, resulting in Dualscar's death. Despite this, the Highblood apparently took the threat Mindfang posed seriously, and sent his wild card, Neophyte Redglare, to apprehend her. His descendant mirrors this action by sending Terezi to deal with Vriska. The cause of the Grand Highblood's own death is unknown.

The Grand Highblood liked to decorate his walls with the blood of his victims. This gory rainbow included blood of all castes (excluding the Condesce's tyrian purple, mutant candy red, and his own caste's purple, however it is the only time which lime blood appears and therefore the only in-comic evidence that it ever existed), which surely pleased him. This mirrors Gamzee writing messages on walls with the blood of his fellow trolls, and writing messages with his own blood in the style of his fellow trolls.

The Grand Highblood is the only ancestor whose name does not follow the eight-letter rule at all. </p>

<p>There isn't a lot of information known about the Grand Highblood so here are some cool pictures of him!</p>
